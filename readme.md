## Usage
Generate an application tokenn and set it as `TOKEN` in `dns.rb`. Optionally you can also set `DOMAIN` and `RECORD`.
First run `bundle install` to install the dependencies.
Afterwards run:

```
ruby dns.rb domain record
```

`domain` and `record` are optional in the above example since you can also set the constants.
